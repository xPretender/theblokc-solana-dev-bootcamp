In this activity, we created a number guessing game. It also familiarized me with the syntax of Rust.
I successfully followed the guide and made my own number_guessing game. The guide is straightforward and educational.
I got a bit confused on the looping part but I eventually got it later on the video.
The video discussed about creating variables, calling variables, looping, conditionals (if conditions), importing library, using library, download external library using cargo.

Code:
use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number");
    println!("Please input your guess: ");
    
    let secret_number: u32 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    loop {
        let mut input = String::new(); 
        match io::stdin().read_line(&mut input) {
            Ok(n) => { 
                println!("{} bytes read", n);
                println!("You guessed: {}", input);
            }
            Err(error) => println!("error: {}", error),
        }
        let guess: u32 = match input.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num, 
            Err(_) => {
                println!("Please enter a valid number.");
                continue;
            }
        };
        
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        }
    }
}
